# Data Warehousing pNEUMA Open Traffic Data
## 🚁 City Traffic Data Collection with Swarm UAVs

This project involves leveraging swarm UAVs (drones) to gather critical traffic data from various locations within the city. The collected data aims to enhance traffic flow and contribute to undisclosed projects led by the city traffic department. Our startup is tasked with the development of a scalable data warehouse designed to accommodate vehicle trajectory data. This data is extracted through the analysis of footage captured by both swarm drones and static roadside cameras. Join us as we build the foundation for innovative solutions in urban traffic management. 🌐🚗📊
